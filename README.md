# Employee Churn Analysis at Salifort Motors - Data Science Capstone Project 

This repository contains the code, documentation, and results for the Data Science Capstone Project completed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate. The project focuses on analyzing an HR employee dataset from Salifort Motors, a fictional company, with the objective of understanding the factors that impact employee churn. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive classification models were developed to gain insights and predict employee churn.

## Project Overview

Employee churn, or the voluntary or involuntary departure of employees from a company, can have significant impacts on business performance and productivity. The goal of this project is to analyze the HR employee dataset of Salifort Motors to identify factors that contribute to employee churn. By understanding these factors, the company can take proactive measures to retain valuable employees and improve overall employee satisfaction.

The project consists of the following major steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Perform an initial exploration of the dataset, assess data quality, and handle missing values or outliers as necessary. Prepare the data for further analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct in-depth exploratory analysis to gain insights into the dataset. Explore various features and their relationships with employee churn. Visualize key findings and trends.
3. **Predictive Modeling:** Build and evaluate classification models to predict employee churn. Utilize machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests to train the models. Perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize model performance.
4. **Model Evaluation and Interpretation:** Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Interpret the model results and identify the most important features contributing to employee churn.
5. **Recommendations and Conclusion:** Summarize the key findings from the analysis and provide actionable recommendations for Salifort Motors based on the insights gained. Discuss limitations, potential future improvements, and the overall significance of the project.

## Conclusion

This Data Science Capstone Project provides a comprehensive analysis of the HR employee dataset from Salifort Motors, with a focus on understanding factors that impact employee churn. By leveraging exploratory data analysis and building predictive classification models, valuable insights were gained, and accurate predictions of employee churn were made. The project outcomes can be used to inform strategic decision-making and HR policies to improve employee retention and job satisfaction at Salifort Motors.

Note: As this is a fictional project, the dataset and company mentioned are not real. The project was completed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate program and serves as a demonstration of data analysis and modeling skills.
